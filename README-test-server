Using test-server as a quickstart
---------------------------------

$ make
$ ./test-server

should be enough to get a test server listening on port 7861.

If you point your browser (eg, Chrome) to

  http://127.0.0.1:7681

It will fetch "test.html", and then run the script in there
on the browser to open a websocket connection.  Incrementing
numbers should appear in the browser display.

test-server.c is all that is needed to use libwebsockets for
serving both the script html over http and websockets.
